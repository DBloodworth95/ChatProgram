# Chat Program

My first exploration into network programming, A client/server Instant Messaging application - utilising Java Sockets.

## Getting Started

Run "ServerMain" class file in the ChatServer dir to boot up the server (localhost). <br />
Run "UserListPane" class file in the ChatClient dir to run a client. <br />
Enter a username and start chatting!

### Prerequisites

```
MySql server for chat history. Credentials can be changed in "QueryHandler" class file, found in the ChatClient dir.
```

### Enjoy!
